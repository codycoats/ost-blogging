2. A user can select a blog that they own and write a post to that blog. A post consists of a title and a body, which will be entered via a CGI form.

8. Whenpostscontainlinks(textthatbeginswith http:// or https://),they will be displayed as HTML links when viewed. If a link ends with .jpg, .png, or .gif, it will be displayed inline rather than as a link.
